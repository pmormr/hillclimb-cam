# Frame-flow watchdog for cam-stream@<instance>.
#
# Detects a stalled encoder (ffmpeg output no longer advancing) and recovers.
# The output signal is ffmpeg's -progress out_time_us. Only a *stably running*
# instance is judged: if the service is down or its MainPID changed, it is
# already flapping/restarting on its own (Restart=always) -- e.g. an SRT/network
# drop -- so the watchdog rebaselines and stays out.
#
# Recovery is scoped to the failure it targets:
#   - stalled AND process in D (uninterruptible) state  -> device wedge a restart
#     cannot clear -> reboot (rate-limited so it can never boot-loop).
#   - stalled in any other state -> restart the service. If the underlying wedge
#     persists, the fresh ffmpeg hangs in D and is rebooted on a later cycle --
#     so escalation is automatic.
#
# Runs as root (needs systemctl restart/reboot). See README.md.
